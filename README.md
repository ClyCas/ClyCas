## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a 32-year-old **Statistician, Biostatistician, Data Scientist, & Researcher** specialized in **biostatistics & machine learning** with extensive research experience in analysis of large datasets, and biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes from **multi-omics** and the **vaginal microbiome**.

Currently, I serve as **Data Analyst** for the **Multi-omics for Mothers and Infants (MOMI) Consortium** at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working on identifying novel multi-omics predictive biomarkers for preterm birth, stillbirth, preeclampsia, small for gestation age, and fetal growth restriction. I'm also a **Research Fellow** with the **Vaginal Microbiome Research Consortium (VMRC)**, identifying markers from the vaginal microbiome predictive of preterm birth and stillbirth.

Additionally, I'm a **Part-Time Lecturer** teaching Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Zambia (UNZA) and Levy Mwanawasa Medical University (LMMU).

🎓 **Education:**
- **MSc in Medical Statistics** (2020-2022) - University of Zambia
  - Specialization: Biostatistics & Epidemiology
- **BSc in Mathematics** (2014-2018) - The Copperbelt University
